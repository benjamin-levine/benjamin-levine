## Hi there 👋

I am a university student at Northern Arizona University currently studying Software Engineering. I primarily specialize in Front-End but I am always learning Full-Stack development to improve my skills.

I am also interested in cybersecurity and have been taking time to learn and plan to take certification exams in the near future.
